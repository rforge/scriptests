Description: Support for using .Rt (transcript) tests
  in the tests directory of a package.  Provides more
  convenience and features than the standard .R/.Rout.save
  tests.  Tests can be run under R CMD check and also
  interactively.  Provides source.pkg() for quickly loading
  code, DLLs, and data from a package for use in an
  edit/compile/test development cycle.
