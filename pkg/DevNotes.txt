Interactive test running:

* Run tests using evalCapture() in RtTests/R/oldcode.R (move this function out of there, and need a loop for running all the tests in a file)

  - Look for the construct 'ThisPkg:::name' in tests and replace it with 'name' if ThisPkg is not attached as a package

=================== older notes (from NOTES.testing.txt)
What I want from a testing harness:
  (1) works from transcripts (to avoid unnecessary duplication of commands in .R and .Rout.save files)
  (2) control which tests within a transcript are run based on env vars, R version, etc.
  (3) control which transcripts are used from the command line
  (4) all specified tests should be run even if the output for some doesn't match or if
      any test stops with an error.
  (5) flexibility in matching output
  (6) concise reporting of which tests failed
  (7) automatic detection of whether some tests failed or succeeded
  (8) want tests to run normally on other installations (don't need 6 & 7)

***** Aug 24, 2007 Thinking about how to achieve this within Rcmd check ...

(1) have this, via createRfromRt.R (need to put this in a .Rin file -- could automatically generate this in a harness around Rcmd check)
(2) could implement by enhancing createRfromRt.R
(3) harness around Rcmd check could generate tests/Makevars (see R-2.5.0/bin/check, line "open(MAKEVARS,...") - or could have an R function to run test scripts and report the results (using the facilities I put in RUnit for which I never got a reply)
(4) need to put something like: options(error=function() NULL) at the start of the file of commands
(5) use a custom Rdiff, and have it leave summary files - can specify Rdiff program in tests/Makefile (not in tests/Makevars because we can't leave that file in the distribution, because it contains installation specific paths)
(6) harness can do the concise reporting - or can do it with a final 'make' target
(7) harness can automatically detect how many important tests failed
(8) is a problem because Makevars has installation-specific paths

Note that the makefile that runs each test is a sub-make,
and it only gets passed "Makevars" and not "Makefile" (that
exists in the tests directory).  This makes it difficult to
modify the value of RDIFF in the makefile.

Sub-make gets invoked like this:
make -f /usr/local/lib64/R/share/make/tests.mk -f Makevars ${out}

However, a line in tests/Makefile to modify
tests/Makevars might work, except that the changes don't
appear to be picked up when running...

Need to think about how I could automatically process .Rt
files to create .R and .Rout.save files.  Not easy to add
these to the list of targets (test-src-1 or test-src-auto
because those are set in Makevars, which is read after
Makefile, and I can't modify Makevars before Makefile is
read...)

Can have a tests/Makefile that will be read in addition to the regular makefile.  Note the following:
 * best not to have tests/Makevars, because having a permanent one makes Rcmd check not use its own Makevars - it contains paths and the list of targets
 * tests/Makefile is NOT read by the sub-make that runs the tests
 * tests/Makefile can add to tests/Makevars once it is created
 * tests/Makefile can change the targets

So a plan could be to have a custom tests/Makefile that does the following:
 (a) redefine default targets to do the following:
 (b) add a line to tests/Makevars to redefine RDIFF
 (c) create .R and .Rout.save files from .Rt files
 (d) add targets for the .Rt files in new targets (can't
     redefine test-src-1 because tests/Makefile is read
     before tests/Makevars) But maybe could redefine test-out
     to add targets for the .Rt files -- no -- because
     the redefinition has to happen in the top level
     invocation of make.
I think the best approach might be to have tests/Makefile
have a special target for Rt files, and it generates a list
of .Rout targets using file listing, and calls a sub-make
the same way the 'all' target in tests.mk does.

Note that it would be good to use the .Rout rule in the system
makefile because it differs for Windows.

Windows wrinkle: need to specify wintests.mk in the rt-tests
rule under windows ... how can make find out the
architecture? -- or can use both Makefile and Makefile.win
(Makefile.win could just define a var and include Makefile
...?)

Also, using R to implement the diff would be a good
application for a scripting version of R, if that exists yet
(look up 'littler'?)

test-out = change-Rdiff.Rout $(test-src:.R=.Rout)


Thinking about if I could write a diff program in R (that would be more flexible ...)
$ Rterm --slave --vanilla -e 'library(trackObjs);cat("Hello",commandArgs(TRUE),"\n")' --args a b c
Hello a b c

Some more techniques for using in make files:

allrt := $(wildcard *.Rt)
allout := $(allrt:.Rt=.Rout.save)
allin := $(allrt:.Rt=.R)

all: $(allout)

$(allout): %.Rout.save: %.Rt
        @echo Creating $@ and $*.R from $<
        @echo '> # file generated automatically in' `pwd` on `date` | cat - $< > $@
        @sed -rne 's/^[>+] ?//p' $@ > $*.R
        @# massage the .Rout.save file to make the Rdiff.sh return no differences
        @echo '' > $*.R.tmp ; echo '' >> $*.R.tmp
        @echo '> ' | cat $@ - >> $*.R.tmp
        @mv $*.R.tmp $@

clean1:
        rm $(allrt:.Rt=.R)

$(allin): %.R: %.Rout.save
        sed -rne 's/^[>+] ?//p' $< > $@
        echo '' > $@.tmp ; echo '' >> $@.tmp
        echo '> ' | cat $< - >> $@.tmp
        mv $@.tmp $<
        touch $@

****** Old notes
in bin/check:
        ## Option '--no-install' turns off installation and the tests
        ## which require the package to be installed.  When testing
        ## recommended packages bundled with R we can skip installation,
        ## and do so if '--install=skip' was given.  If command line
        ## option '--install' is of the form 'check:FILE', it is assumed
        ## that installation was already performed with stdout/stderr to
        ## FILE, the contents of which need to be checked (without
        ## repeating the installation).
        ## <NOTE>
        ## In this case, one also needs to specify *where* the package
        ## was installed to using command line option '--library'.
        ## Perhaps we should check for that, although '--install=check'
        ## is really only meant for repository maintainers.
        ## </NOTE>

tests are run in bin/check, code starting at line 1858:
    ## Run the package-specific tests.

Looks like make is used in the tests directory - to run the tests?

Looks like make is run with this command:
        if(R_system("${R::Vars::MAKE} $makefiles $makevars")) {

a "Makevars" file is constructed and left in the tests directory

The makefiles are in:
./share/make/tests.mk
./src/gnuwin32/fixed/share/tests.mk
./bin/check

added a rule for Rt->R&Rout.save to tests.mk

added code to bin/check to write .R for .Rt files to the Makevars

then that worked to have just .Rt files.... :-)

Next want to investigate how to run individual tests, and tests
without building..., and how to provide better comparing of test
output and targets

Maybe I can have .Rin files construct .R and .Rout.save
files from .Rt files (or maybe the .Rin file can use the
.Rout.save file because .Rout.save files are referred to in
the original source location, not in the directory where
tests are run and files created -- yes, I think that will
work)

Another way would be to have a .R file that reads the
.Rout.save file, executes the commands within it & puts the
output in .Rout, and lets R CMD check compare .Rout and
.Rout.save.

Another way would be to have a .R file that reads the
corresponding .Rt file, executes commands and compares
output, and exits with an error if errors are found (or
continues, if the environment is set up in a certain way.)
